          <PolicySection title="2. Certain General Principles, Terms, and Disclaimers">
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information about you
              in the possession of CSO, including information obtained through
              CSO's websites: the CSO website, together with all other websites
              operated by CSO group of Companies. By using, accessing, or
              registering with the Website, you consent to our collection and
              use of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy
              Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Privacy Policy does not supersede the Terms and Condition of
              Use that governs your use of the Website. Any conflict between the
              two shall be determined in favor of the Terms and Conditions of
              Use. CSO may change this Privacy Policy at any time and any
              changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the Website,
              so please check back regularly to ensure you read and understand
              our current privacy policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              While information is critical to our ability to provide high
              quality service to you, our most important asset is the trust that
              our visitors place in how we provide that service. Keeping visitor
              information secure and using it only as our visitors would want us
              to, is a top priority for all of us at CSO. Consequently our
              privacy standards are designed to, on a commercially reasonable
              basis: collect and use only the minimum information necessary for
              us to deliver high quality service to users, to administer our
              business, and to let you know of products and services that are
              available from CSO and trusted third parties; protect the
              information our visitors share with us, maintaining strong
              standards of security and confidentiality; require any other
              organization that we retain or engage to provide support services
              to us to conform to our privacy standards; and keep visitor files,
              if any, complete, up to date, and accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
              We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from users
              browsing the Website. We do use first- and third-party Cookies to
              collect basic technological information about how visitors use the
              Website as described more fully in Section 4. This data is used to
              improve content, site performance, and services for our visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some features on the Website may require you to register as a user
              and to receive our authorization before you can use those
              features, including forums, mailing lists, program registrations,
              and other services. For you to obtain our authorization to use
              those features and to be considered as a registered user, you may
              be required to provide us with certain Personally Identifiable
              Information ("PII") about you or your business. The PII we collect
              can include names, addresses, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers,
              fax numbers, education and certifications, areas of specialty,
              credit card numbers, and other forms of PII.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we have authorized you as a registered user, we may provide
              you with a customer identification number and you will select a
              unique Username and Password. Generally, you will be able to
              change your Password and update any PII you have given us
              (instructions on how to make these changes can be found in Section
              6 of this Privacy Policy).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have access to the Website as a designated representative
              of a business, CSO may terminate your right to use the Website
              upon notification that you are no longer a designated
              representative for the said business.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are submitting PII on behalf of others in your family,
              business, or other organization for registration purposes or
              otherwise, you represent that you have their permission, agreement
              and full authorization to provide this information to us. We
              reserve the right (a) to ask you to provide evidence of your
              authority at any time during, or even after, the submission
              process and (b) to contact those individuals to confirm your
              authority at any time. If we determine that your authority has not
              been properly obtained, we may immediately and without notice to
              you, discontinue your authorized use of those features of the
              Website for which you have registered.
            </p>
          </PolicySection>

          <PolicySection title="3. Who Collects Information Through the Website">
            <p>
              Subject to this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions of Use,
              and any other rules or policies applicable to the Website, CSO
              collects the information described in this policy through the
              Website.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, CSO has engaged third party vendors to help us manage
              our web presence and allow us to better serve our web visitors.
              Personal information submitted to CSO through third party managed
              pages may be shared with these vendors as necessary for completing
              authorized transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              CSO has also provided external links to other websites in order to
              provide those who use the Website with a better, more fulfilling
              experience. Once you enter another website (whether through an
              advertisement, service or content link), be aware that CSO is not
              responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites (see
              also Section 10 of the Terms and Conditions of Use). We encourage
              you to look for and review the privacy statements of each and
              every website that you visit through a link or sponsorship notice.

          <PolicySection title="4. Information We Collect and How it is Used">
            <p>
              If you use the Website without registering, we will only collect
              anonymous Non-Personal Information ("NPI"), about you through the
              use of first- and third-party Cookies and other technical means
              (described in more detail in this Section 4).
            </p>
            <p>
              If you choose to register with the Website to use interactive or
              other specific services, we require you to submit certain PII,
              such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax
              number, education and certification, areas of specialty, and
              credit card number. While you may use some of the functionality of
              the Website without registration, many specific tools and services
              on the Website require registration and your submission of PII.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> How we collect NPI.</strong> We collect certain NPI about
              your use of the Website through our use of first- and third-party
              Cookies and through other technical means (eg Click Stream
              Information such as log files, Web Beacons, etc.). This NPI
              includes information about the date and time you visit the
              Website, which pages you view, how you arrive at the Website
              (through referring links or otherwise), how much time you spend on
              the Website, your IP address, and the type of Browser and
              operating system you use.
            </p>

            <p>
              We encourage you to research online resources and learn about not
              only Cookies but also the other technical means through which
              information about you may be collected through websites you visit.
              Your Browser can be set to reject all Cookies. A "help" section of
              most Browsers' toolbar usually offers instructions on how to reset
              the browser to reject Cookies.

              If you reject our Cookies, certain functions and conveniences of
              the Website may not work properly, including those sections that
              are only available to registered users, but{" "}

            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, if you visit the Website through a link from an email
              newsletter sent by CSO, our system will log such information as
              what links the you click through from the e-mail to the Website,
              the date and time of your click through, the name of the link or
              source from which the message was sent, the tracking URL number,
              and the destination page.

              Generally, the NPI we collect about you is attached to arbitrary,
              anonymous system names that are assigned to visitors when they
              enter the Website. Please note, however, that during the
              registration process, or at other times during your use of the
              Website, we may ask for your permission to link your NPI with your
              PII. In addition, the providers of third-party Cookies may have
              the ability to link your activities on the Website with your
              browsing activities elsewhere on the Internet.

              <strong> Examples of how we may use NPI.</strong> The anonymous
              NPI we obtain from you is generally used to render, administer,
              and improve the Website, our services, and our business. We may
              use NPI to do any of the following (please note that this list is
              representative and provided only to assist you in understanding
              how we might use the NPI we collect).

              <strong> Disclosure of Aggregate Information.</strong> CSO may
              provide Aggregate Information to third parties. For example, we
              might inform third parties regarding the number of users of the
              Website and the activities they conduct while on the Website. We
              might for example inform a Partner / Vendor company (that may or
              may not be sponsor of the Website) that "30% of our users live in
              India” or that "25% of our users have applied Flight Training
              Programs." We require parties with whom we share Aggregate
              Information to agree that they will not attempt to make this
              information PII, such as by combining it with other databases.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> How we collect PII.</strong> The PII that we collect, and
              store generally consists of information gathered when you register
              with the Website for specific services and / or when you update
              any registration or profile information, but may also include
              other data input, forms, and information you provide to us whether
              electronically, by phone, by fax, in writing, in person, or by any
              other means. Your PII may also include information about your
              transactions and experiences with CSO, including account balances
              and purchasing activity. If you provide us with PII through the
              Website, we will give you the opportunity to "Opt-Out" of
              receiving future communications from us related to the specific
              service for which we requested that information. Section 7 of this
              Privacy Policy more specifically describes how to manage your
              communications preferences and to opt-in or opt-out of
              communications from us.
            </p>

              How we use PII. We use PII, and any data, personal or otherwise,
              that you provide and which may be saved on the Website, to provide

              register for a Program / Workshop, or pay your dues
              electronically, your personal information and Credit Card / Debit
              Card information are encrypted using industry-standard SSL
              Encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. We
              submit to the appropriate credit card clearinghouse only the
              information necessary to collect payment. All Credit Card / Debit
              Card information retained by CSO, including Credit Card / Debit
              Card numbers if you elect to store them on your account, is
              compliant with Payment Card Industry data security standards.

            <p>
              If paying by a Credit Card / Debit Card, payment processing
              (including the card number input) is on a secure page processing
              system which has passed the international certification. It means
              that your confidential data (card details, registration
              information, etc.) are not available for CSO personnel, the
              processing is fully protected and no one, including CSO, cannot
              obtain personal and banking data of the customer.
            </p>

            <p>
              When working with card data CSO uses security standards of
              information protection developed by the international payment
              systems such as Visa and MasterCard - Payment Card Industry Data
              Security Standard (PCI DSS). It ensures safe processing of the
              details of bank card holder. The technology guarantees the
              security of data during transactions with bank cards using several
              protocols: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Verified by Visa, Secure
              Code, and private banking networks with the highest degree of
              protection.
            </p>

            <p>
              In case of a return, the money is returned to the same card with

              CSO is committed to keeping user information secure, and
              implements commercially reasonable security measures to protect
              against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
              disclosure or destruction of data. Access to data and technology
              relating to user information is password-protected and limited to
              authorized personnel and those vendors that require access to the
              information in order to furnish services to CSO and our members.
              In addition, CSO uses industry standard technology to keep users'
              information secure while residing on CSO' s servers.
            </p>
            <p>

              Despite CSO's efforts to protect your PII, there is always some
              risk that an unauthorized third party may breach our security
              systems or that your transmissions of information over the
              Internet could be intercepted by third parties. CSO is not

          <PolicySection title="9. How the Interactive Areas of the Website Operate">
            <p>
              As a service to our users, the Website may feature message boards,
              chat rooms, and / or other public forums where users can share
              information or where users can post questions. We may also offer
              online discussions moderated by medical or healthcare experts.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition, you may choose to use certain interactive content,
              tools, and services that ask you to voluntarily provide
              information about yourself. Some of these tools (like certain
              quizzes or calculators) do not retain information, while others
              may store information in accordance with the authorization you
              provide at the time you use the service or tool. Please be aware
              of this fact.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any chat room, message board, forum or similar interactive service
              is by design open to the public and is not a private, secure
              service. CSO is not responsible for the privacy of information
              voluntarily provided by a user in interactive areas. You should
              think carefully before disclosing any PII in any public forum
              because what you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or
              collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we
              are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for
              purposes unauthorized by you.

              Aggregate Information. As a website gathers individual pieces of
              Non-Personal Information from its users, it may combine similar
              data from many or all the users of the website into one big
              "batch."

            <p>
              This sort of statistical information is called aggregate data
              because it reflects the habits and characteristics of a large
              group of anonymous people. Websites may use aggregate data or
              share it with business associates so that the information and
              services they provide best meet the needs of the users. aggregate
              data also helps advertisers and sponsors on the Website know how
              effectively they are reaching and meeting the needs of their
              target audience.

              <strong> Cookie.</strong> A small data file that is stored on the

              contain pieces of Personally Identifiable Information. CSO
              encrypts any PII it stores in first party Cookies. These Cookies
              often are used to make the site easier to use. For example, if you
              check a box to ask that we store your Username on your computer so
              that you don't have to enter it each time you visit the site, it's

              <strong>Encryption.</strong> The translation of data into a secret
              code. Encryption is the most effective way to achieve data
              security. To read an encrypted file, you must have access to a
              secret key or Password that enables you to decrypt it. This is
              typically done by so called "secure computer systems."

              <strong>Firewall.</strong> A system designed to prevent
              unauthorized access to or from a public or private network.
              Firewalls can be implemented in both hardware and software, or a
              combination of both. Firewalls are frequently used to prevent
              unauthorized users from accessing private portions of public
              networks. All messages entering or leaving the network pass
              through the firewall, which examines each message and blocks those
              that do not meet specified security criteria.

              Non-Personal Information, as is information such as gender, age,
              city, and physical location, when not linked with other Personally
              Identifiable Information.

              <strong> Opt-In.</strong> Means you are actively indicating your
              preference to participate in a program, email, feature, tool, or
              enhancement on a website. Typically, if you "Opt-in" you must
              provide certain information, usually Personally Identifiable
              Information, to the website or otherwise actively indicate your
              choice or preference to participate in the website program
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> Opt-Out.</strong> Means that if you do not take some
              action you are indicating your preference to participate in a
              program, email, feature, tool, or enhancement on a website.
              Typically, if you "Opt-Out" you must uncheck a box next to a
              stated preference or otherwise take some indicate action to
              indicate your preference not to participate in a program.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong> Password.</strong> A secret series of characters,
              typically alphanumeric (meaning it consists of both letters and
              numbers) that enables a user to access a file, computer, or
              program. The user must enter its, his, or her password before the
              computer or system will respond to commands. The password helps
              ensure that unauthorized users do not access the system. In
              addition, data files and programs may require a password.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ideally, the password should be something that nobody could guess.
              In practice, many people choose a password that is easy to
              remember, such as their name or their initials. This is one reason
              it is relatively easy to break into many computer systems.

              <strong>Personally Identifiable Information ("PII").</strong>{" "}
              Information that can be traced back to an individual (in contrast
              to Non-Personal Information and Aggregate Information). Examples
              of PII include your name, home address, telephone number, email
              address, and Social Security number.
            </p>

            <p>
              If other pieces of information are linked to PII, they also become
              PII. For example, if you use a nickname to chat online and give
              out your real name while chatting, your nickname becomes PII when
              linked with other PII.

              <strong> Server.</strong> A computer that provides services to

              developed by Netscape for transmitting private information via the
              Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that's
              transferred over the SSL connection. All major Browsers, including
              Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome,
              Opera, and Apple Safari, support SSL, and many websites use the
              protocol to transmit confidential user information, such as credit
              card numbers. By convention, URLs that utilize an SSL connection
              start with https:instead of http:.
